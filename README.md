   The distributable file is already built for you:

   You may rename `index.js` to something more descriptive, such as `fortune-cookie-broker.jssp`:

   ```
3. **Upload in K2**  
   - Navigate to  
     `System > Management > SmartObjects > SmartObjects > JavaScript Service Provider`
   - Click **Create or Update from File** and select your `.jssp` file.

### Option 2: Deploy by URL
